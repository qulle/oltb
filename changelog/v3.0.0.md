# 3.0.0
TBA

## Info
- New major version due to changed project structure. 
- Added JEST and unittests. The testing that is added now is a base-layer of tests that will catch larger logical errors. Will add more tests in the future and re-work the base-layer to be more consistent and follow the same semantics as the implementation files.

## New Features
- Added SCSS to allow for images in the Info-Window.

## Refactoring
- Broken down larger methods into smaller reusable units.

## Bugs
- Fixed wrong name of callback for when browser state is cleared onBrowserStateClear -> onBrowserStateCleared
    - DrawTool
    - ScissorsTool
    - ZoomboxTool
- Undefined window.binding for Events.custom.read -> Events.custom.ready
    - ScissorsTool
- localStorage was referenced instead of sessionStorage
    - DebugInfoModal
- Wrong property key for layer visibility visible -> isVisible
    - BookmarkTool
