# 3.0.0
2024-08-01

## Info
- New major version due to changed project structure.
- Added JEST and unittests. The testing that is added now is a base-layer of tests that will catch larger logical errors. Will add more tests in the future and re-work the base-layer to be more consistent and follow the same semantics as the implementation files.
- The main thing that is required for those of you who are already using the package is to update your imports. Please see the example folder.
