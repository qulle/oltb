# 2.0.0
TBA

Info: 
- New main version due to broken contract with the consumer. All callback functions now have the prefix 'on', for example onClick. Major code refactoring to standardize names and how the tools create objects in the map and toolbox.

New Features:
- Added browser information object to DebugInfoModal
- Added Sortabje.js to allow for layers and bookmarks to be dragged to change order (ZIndex)
- Added new callback function to BookmarkTool (onDragged)
- Added new callback functions to LayerTool (onFeatureLayerDragged, onMapLayerDragged) 

Code Quality:
- Change from spread-operator to lodash merge, to avoid cross references in objects with depth > 1
- Prefixed references to HTML elements with 'uiRef'

Packages:
- browser-dtector 3.3.0
- sortablejs 1.15.0
- lodash 4.17.21
