# 2.0.0
2024-01-14

## Info
- New major version due to changed callback-contract with the consumer. All callback functions now have the prefix 'on', for example onClicked. The callback functions have also been change to trigger after the action has been done. This is also reflected in the name where it is given in past tense. 

- Major code refactoring to standardize names and how the tools create objects in the Map and Toolbox. All event callbacks are also prefixed with 'on'. Event handlers now have limited internal logic to only call internal methods that can then be called and reused between multiple methods in the same tool.

- Major code refactoring to enable multiple language support. The user can load any number of languages without the need to rebuild the application.
