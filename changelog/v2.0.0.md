# 2.0.0
TBA

Info: 
- New main version due to changed callback-contract with the consumer. All callback functions now have the prefix 'on', for example onClicked. The callback functions have also been change to trigger after the action has been done. This is also reflected in the name where it is given in past tense. 

- Major code refactoring to standardize names and how the tools create objects in the Map and Toolbox. All event callbacks are also prefixed with 'on'. Event handlers now have limited internal logic to only call internal methods that can then be called and reused between multiple methods in the same tool.

New Features:
- Added new tool 'ZoomBoxTool'
- Added new tool 'ScissorsTool'
- Added Sortabje.js to allow for Layers and Bookmarks to be dragged to change order 'zIndex'
- Added new callback function to 'BookmarkTool' 'onDragged'
- Added new callback functions to LayerTool 'onFeatureLayerDragged' and 'onMapLayerDragged'
- Added new callback function to all tools that have a state saved in localStorage 'onBrowserStateCleared'
- Added new callback function to all tools 'onInitiated'
- Added new callback function to 'DrawTool' 'onSnapped'
- Added new callback function to 'MeasureTool' 'onSnapped'
- Added new options to 'BookmarkTool' and 'MyLocationTool'

```

Code Quality:

- Prefixed references to HTML elements with 'uiRef'
- Removed repetitive window.setTimeout and replaced with 'InfoWindow.showOverly' and 'InfoWindow.showDelayedOverlay'
- Improved overall readability of the code, added block-comments to each file to show intent of each section of code

Bugs:
- Fixed PNG export when using OverviewTool, the selector unintentionally targeted the overview-canvas and not the actual map-canvas
